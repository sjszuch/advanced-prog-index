          <p>
            My name is Sebastian Szuch, I'm a senior here at Point Park with a
            major in Computer Science. I hope to get a lot out of this class and
            learn more about programming in a way that can advance my career.
            Over the Summer, I worked as an intern for First National Bank in
            their Application Development department on a large-scale project
            which used Angular and Java, which was a great experience. In the
            future I hope to work as a developer or something similar which
            allows me to utilize both technical and creative skills to solve
            various issues.

          <p>
            I have many interests both related to technology and just in
            general. I spend a good amount of my free time studying music, as
            I've recently became interested in more advanced concepts like music
            theory, and have been trying to advance my skills on guitar,
            especially when it comes to scales and improvisation. I also
            enjoying playing videogames, specifically RPGs and horror games.
